# Compliance Aliases

Shell tools for regulatory compliance and privacy enforcement.

## Overview

Compliance aliases provide essential controls for managing privacy and maintaining audit trails in your shell environment. These aliases help disable telemetry across common CLI tools and track configuration changes for compliance requirements.

## Reference

### Controls

| Alias | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `privacy-mode` | Disables telemetry for CLI tools (Homebrew, Dotnet, Azure, etc.) for the current session. |
| `dot-audit` | Displays the recent configuration audit trail (Git history or Audit log). |
