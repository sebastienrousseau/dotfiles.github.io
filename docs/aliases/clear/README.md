# Clear Aliases

Streamline your terminal workflow with quick screen-clearing shortcuts.

## Overview

The clear aliases provide efficient ways to reset your terminal display while optionally showing useful context like directory contents, command history, or file trees. These aliases are defined in `clear.aliases.sh` and are automatically loaded by chezmoi.
